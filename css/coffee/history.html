<h1>History of Coffee</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Legendary accounts</h2>
<p>
  According to legend, ancestors of today's Oromo people in a region of Kaffa in
  Ethiopia were believed to have been the first to recognize the energizing
  effect of the coffee plant. However, there is no direct evidence that has been
  found earlier than the 15th century indicating where in Africa coffee first
  grew or who among the native populations might have used it as a stimulant.
  The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd who discovered coffee
  when he noticed how excited his goats became after eating the beans from a
  coffee plant, did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.
  Other accounts attribute the discovery of coffee to Sheikh Omar. According to
  an ancient chronicle (preserved in the Abd-Al-Kadir manuscript), Omar, who was
  known for his ability to cure the sick through prayer, was once exiled from
  Mocha in Yemen to a desert cave near Ousab (modern-day Wusab, about 90 km east
  of Zabid). Starving, Omar chewed berries from nearby shrubbery but found them
  to be bitter. He tried roasting the seeds to improve the flavor, but they
  became hard. He then tried boiling them to soften the seed, which resulted in
  a fragrant brown liquid. Upon drinking the liquid Omar was revitalized and
  sustained for days. As stories of this "miracle drug" reached Mocha, Omar was
  asked to return and was made a saint.

<h2>Historical transmission</h2>
<p>
  The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the coffee
  tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed
  al-Ghaffar in Yemen. It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first
  roasted and brewed, in a similar way to how it is prepared now. Coffee was
  used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their religious rituals. Accounts
  differ on the origin of the coffee plant prior to its appearance in Yemen.
  From Ethiopia, coffee could have been introduced to Yemen via trade across the
  Red Sea. One account credits Muhammad Ibn Sa'd for bringing the beverage to
  Aden from the African coast. Other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the
  Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to Arabia. According to
  al Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have encountered coffee during his stay with the
  Adal king Sadadin's companions in 1401. Famous 16th-century Islamic scholar
  Ibn Hajar al-Haytami notes in his writings of a beverage called qahwa
  developed from a tree in the Zeila region.
</p>
<p>
  By the 16th century, coffee had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia,
  Turkey, and northern Africa. The first coffee smuggled out of the Middle East
  was by Sufi Baba Budan from Yemen to Indian subcontinent in 1670. Before then,
  all exported coffee was boiled or otherwise sterilised. Portraits of Baba
  Budan depict him as having smuggled seven coffee seeds by strapping them to
  his chest. The first plants grown from these smuggled seeds were planted in
  Mysore. Coffee then spread to Italy, and to the rest of Europe, to Indonesia,
  and to the Americas. A late 19th century advertisement for coffee essence. A
  coffee can from the first half of the 20th century. From the Museo del Objeto
  del Objeto collection. In 1583, Leonhard Rauwolf, a German physician, gave
  this description of coffee after returning from a ten-year trip to the Near
  East:
</p>

<blockquote>
  A beverage as black as ink, useful against numerous illnesses, particularly
  those of the stomach. Its consumers take it in the morning, quite frankly, in
  a porcelain cup that is passed around and from which each one drinks a cupful.
  It is composed of water and the fruit from a bush called bunnu. — Léonard
  Rauwolf, Reise in die Morgenländer (in German)
</blockquote>

<p>
  From the Middle East, coffee spread to Italy. The thriving trade between
  Venice and North Africa, Egypt, and the Middle East brought many goods,
  including coffee, to the Venetian port. From Venice, it was introduced to the
  rest of Europe. Coffee became more widely accepted after it was deemed a
  Christian beverage by Pope Clement VIII in 1600, despite appeals to ban the
  "Muslim drink." The first European coffee house opened in Rome in 1645.
</p>

<p>
  The Dutch East India Company was the first to import coffee on a large scale.
  The Dutch later grew the crop in Java and Ceylon. The first exports of
  Indonesian coffee from Java to the Netherlands occurred in 1711.
</p>

<p>
  Through the efforts of the British East India Company, coffee became popular
  in England as well. John Evelyn recorded tasting the drink at Oxford in
  England in a diary entry of May 1637 to where it had been brought by an
  Ottoman student of Balliol College from Crete named Nathaniel Conopios of
  Crete. Oxford's Queen's Lane Coffee House, established in 1654, is still in
  existence today. Coffee was introduced in France in 1657, and in Austria and
  Poland after the 1683 Battle of Vienna, when coffee was captured from supplies
  of the defeated Turks.
</p>

<p>
  When coffee reached North America during the Colonial period, it was initially
  not as successful as it had been in Europe as alcoholic beverages remained
  more popular. During the Revolutionary War, the demand for coffee increased so
  much that dealers had to hoard their scarce supplies and raise prices
  dramatically; this was also due to the reduced availability of tea from
  British merchants, and a general resolution among many Americans to avoid
  drinking tea following the 1773 Boston Tea Party. After the War of 1812,
  during which Britain temporarily cut off access to tea imports, the Americans'
  taste for coffee grew.
</p>

<p>
  During the 18th century, coffee consumption declined in England, giving way to
  tea-drinking. The latter beverage was simpler to make, and had become cheaper
  with the British conquest of India and the tea industry there. During the Age
  of Sail, seamen aboard ships of the British Royal Navy made substitute coffee
  by dissolving burnt bread in hot water.
</p>

<p>
  The Frenchman Gabriel de Clieu took a coffee plant to the French territory of
  Martinique in the Caribbean, from which much of the world's cultivated arabica
  coffee is descended. Coffee thrived in the climate and was conveyed across the
  Americas. Coffee was cultivated in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) from 1734, and
  by 1788 it supplied half the world's coffee. The conditions that the slaves
  worked in on coffee plantations were a factor in the soon to follow Haitian
  Revolution. The coffee industry never fully recovered there. It made a brief
  come-back in 1949 when Haiti was the world's 3rd largest coffee exporter, but
  fell quickly into rapid decline.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, coffee had been introduced to Brazil in 1727, although its
  cultivation did not gather momentum until independence in 1822. After this
  time massive tracts of rainforest were cleared for coffee plantations, first
  in the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro and later São Paulo. Brazil went from having
  essentially no coffee exports in 1800, to being a significant regional
  producer in 1830, to being the largest producer in the world by 1852. In
  1910–20, Brazil exported around 70% of the world's coffee, Colombia,
  Guatemala, and Venezuela, exported half of the remaining 30%, and Old World
  production accounted for less than 5% of world exports.
</p>

<p>
  Cultivation was taken up by many countries in Central America in the latter
  half of the 19th century, and almost all involved the large-scale displacement
  and exploitation of the indigenous people. Harsh conditions led to many
  uprisings, coups and bloody suppression of peasants. The notable exception was
  Costa Rica, where lack of ready labor prevented the formation of large farms.
  Smaller farms and more egalitarian conditions ameliorated unrest over the 19th
  and 20th centuries.
</p>

<p>
  Rapid growth in coffee production in South America during the second half of
  the 19th century was matched by growth in consumption in developed countries,
  though nowhere has this growth been as pronounced as in the United States,
  where high rate of population growth was compounded by doubling of per capita
  consumption between 1860 and 1920. Though the United States was not the
  heaviest coffee-drinking nation at the time (Nordic countries, Belgium, and
  Netherlands all had comparable or higher levels of per capita consumption),
  due to its sheer size, it was already the largest consumer of coffee in the
  world by 1860, and, by 1920, around half of all coffee produced worldwide was
  consumed in the US.
</p>

<p>
  Coffee has become a vital cash crop for many developing countries. Over one
  hundred million people in developing countries have become dependent on coffee
  as their primary source of income. It has become the primary export and
  backbone for African countries like Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, and Ethiopia, as
  well as many Central American countries.
