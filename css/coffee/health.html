<h1>Health effects</h1>
<p>
  A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe
  within usual levels of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes
  than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include
  possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible
  increased risk in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight.
  Results were complicated by poor study quality, and differences in age,
  gender, health status, and serving size.

<h3>Mortality</h3>
<p>
  In 2012, the National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study analysed
  the relationship between coffee drinking and mortality. They found that higher
  coffee consumption was associated with lower risk of death, and that those who
  drank any coffee lived longer than those who did not. However the authors
  noted, "whether this was a causal or associational finding cannot be
  determined from our data." A 2014 meta-analysis found that coffee consumption
  (4 cups/day) was inversely associated with all-cause mortality (a 16% lower
  risk), as well as cardiovascular disease mortality specifically (a 21% lower
  risk from drinking 3 cups/day), but not with cancer mortality. Additional
  meta-analysis studies corroborated these findings, showing that higher coffee
  consumption (2–4 cups per day) was associated with a reduced risk of death by
  all disease causes.
</p>

<h3>Cardiovascular disease</h3>
<p>
  Moderate coffee consumption is not a risk factor for coronary heart disease. A
  2012 meta-analysis concluded that people who drank moderate amounts of coffee
  had a lower rate of heart failure, with the biggest effect found for those who
  drank more than four cups a day. A 2014 meta-analysis concluded that
  cardiovascular disease, such as coronary artery disease and stroke, is less
  likely with three to five cups of non-decaffeinated coffee per day, but more
  likely with over five cups per day. A 2016 meta-analysis showed that coffee
  consumption was associated with a reduced risk of death in patients who have
  had a myocardial infarction. Drinking four or more cups of coffee per day does
  not affect the risk of hypertension compared to drinking little or no coffee;
  however, drinking one to three cups per day may be at a slightly increased
  risk.

<h3>Mental health</h3>
<p>
  Long-term preliminary research, including assessment of symptoms for dementia
  and cognitive impairment, was inconclusive for coffee having an effect in the
  elderly, mainly due to the poor quality of the studies. There appears to be a
  beneficial relationship between coffee intake and Parkinson's disease as well
  as coffee intake and depression.
</p>

<h3>Parkinson's disease</h3>
<p>
  Meta-analyses have consistently found that long-term coffee consumption is
  associated with a lower risk of Parkinson's disease.
</p>

<h3>Type II diabetes</h3>
<p>
  In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 prospective observational
  studies, representing over one million participants, every additional cup of
  caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumed in a day was associated,
  respectively, with a 9% and 6% lower risk of type 2 diabetes.
</p>

<h3>Cancer</h3>
<p>
  The effects of coffee consumption on cancer risk remain unclear, with reviews
  and meta-analyses showing either no relationship or a slightly lower risk of
  cancer onset. Studies suggest that coffee consumption of 2 cups per/day was
  associated with a 14% increased risk of developing lung cancer, but only among
  people who smoke.
